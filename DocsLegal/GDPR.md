# Microsoft’s GDPR Commitments to Customers of our Generally Available Enterprise Software Products

**Introduction**

The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets a new bar worldwide for privacy rights, information security, and compliance. In Microsoft, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right and that the GDPR is an important step ahead in protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals.     

Microsoft is committed to its own compliance with the GDPR, as well as to provide an array of products, features, documentation, and resources, in order to support our customers in meeting their compliance obligations under the GDPR. Below is a description of Microsoft’s contractual commitments to its customers with respect to personal data collected from enterprise software:

**Does Microsoft make commitments to its customers with respect to the GDPR?**

Yes. The GDPR requires that controllers (such as organisations and developers using Microsoft’s enterprise online services) use only processors (such as Microsoft), which process personal data on behalf of the controller and provide sufficient guarantees to meet key requirements of the GDPR. Microsoft has taken the proactive step in providing these commitments to all enterprise online service customers as part of their subscription agreements and to volume licensing customers as part of their enterprise agreements. Customers of other generally available enterprise software, which is licensed by Microsoft or our affiliates, also enjoy the benefits of Microsoft’s GDPR commitments, as described in this notice, to the extent of the software processes personal data.

**Where can I find Microsoft’s contractual commitments with respect to the GDPR?**

You can find Microsoft’s contractual commitments with regard to the GDPR in the [Online Services Data Protection Addendum](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=2&Keyword=DPA), which provides Microsoft’s privacy and security commitments, data processing terms and GDPR Terms for Microsoft-hosted services to which customers subscribe under a volume licensing agreement. These terms commit Microsoft to the requirements of processors in GDPR Article 28 and other relevant articles of the GDPR. 

Microsoft extends the GDPR Terms to all customers of generally available enterprise software products licensed by us or our affiliates under the Microsoft software license terms, effective as on 25 May, 2018 irrespective of the applicable version of the enterprise software, to the extent that Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in relation with such software, and as long as Microsoft continues to offer or support the version. Support details can be found in the Microsoft Lifecyle Policy at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle.

For clarity, different or lesser commitments may apply to beta or preview software, software, which has been materially modified, or any software licensed by Microsoft or our affiliates, which is not made generally available to the public or otherwise not licensed under the Microsoft software license terms. Some products may collect and send to Microsoft telemetry or other data by default; the product documentation provides information and instructions about how to turn off or configure such telemetry collection.

**What commitments are there in the GDPR Terms?**

Microsoft’s GDPR Terms reflect the commitments required from processors in Article 28 of the GDPR.  Article 28 requires that processors commit to:

-	use subprocessors only with the consent of the controller and remain liable for subprocessors;
-	process personal data only on instructions of the controller, including those with respect to transfers;
-	ensure that the persons, who process personal data, are committed to confidentiality;
-	implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, in order to ensure a level of personal data security appropriate for the risk;
-	assist the controller in its obligations to respond to requests of data subjects to exercise their GDPR rights;
-	respond to the GDPR’s breach notification and assistance requirements;
-	assist the controller in data protection impact assessments and consultation with supervisory authorities; 
-	delete or return personal data at the end of provision of services; and
-	support the controller with evidence of compliance with the GDPR.
